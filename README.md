# Waste Management using artificial intelligence

The accumulation in urban area is becoming a great concern,and it would result in environment pollution and may be hazardous to human health if it is not properly managed.
We developed a waste classification system that is able to separate different components of waste using machine learning tools.
This system can be used to automatically classify waste and help in reducing human intervention and preventing infection and pollution.
